# Project Orbitron

To develop a network of AI-powered drones with peer-to-peer communication and
intelligence-sharing capabilities, you’ll need a combination of drone hardware,
sensors, computing modules, and communication systems. Here's a detailed
breakdown of the hardware required:

### 1. **Drone Platform**

- **Off-the-shelf Drones**: Ready-to-fly (RTF) drones with programmable flight
  controllers are ideal for development. Look into models like **DJI Matrice**,
  **Parrot Anafi**, or custom-built drones using **PX4** or **ArduPilot** flight
  controllers.
- **Custom Drones**: If you plan to build custom drones, you’ll need to source
  parts like frames, motors, electronic speed controllers (ESCs), and
  propellers.

### 2. **Flight Controller**

- **PX4** or **ArduPilot** are highly customizable open-source flight
  controllers that support autonomous flight and communication with onboard
  systems.
- They offer integration with GPS, accelerometers, gyros, and magnetometers for
  flight stabilization and navigation.

### 3. **Onboard Computing**

- **NVIDIA Jetson Nano/Xavier**: Provides powerful GPU capabilities for AI
  inference (ideal for computer vision, object detection, face recognition,
  etc.).
- **Raspberry Pi 4**: A cost-effective option for less computationally intensive
  tasks like communication and basic object detection.
- **Intel RealSense T265** or **Intel Neural Compute Stick** for additional AI
  capabilities on lightweight drones.

### 4. **Cameras and Sensors**

- **RGB Cameras**: For object and face detection. You can use modules like the
  **Raspberry Pi Camera** or **Intel RealSense D435** for depth perception.
- **Thermal Cameras**: Like the **FLIR Lepton** for detecting heat signatures in
  low visibility environments.
- **LiDAR Sensors**: Essential for precise topographical mapping and obstacle
  detection. Examples: **RPLiDAR**, **Hokuyo URG**.
- **GPS Module**: High-precision GPS like **Ublox Neo-M8N** for navigation and
  geolocation.
- **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)**: Integrate accelerometers, gyroscopes, and
  magnetometers for stabilizing flight.

### 5. **Communication Systems**

- **Mesh Networking Modules**:
  - **LoRa** (Long Range, low power): For communication over long distances in
    low-bandwidth applications.
  - **Wi-Fi Ad-hoc/Direct**: For high-bandwidth, short-range peer-to-peer data
    sharing. Supports streaming video, images, and large datasets.
  - **4G/5G Modems**: For long-range communication and internet connectivity,
    especially in remote areas.
- **RF Transceivers**: For short-range, high-speed communication (e.g., **XBee**
  or **nRF24L01**).

### 6. **Power System**

- **LiPo Batteries**: Choose based on your drone’s power requirements, factoring
  in the payload of computing hardware and sensors. Higher cell counts (3S, 4S,
  etc.) offer more power.
- **Battery Management System (BMS)**: Ensures safe charging and discharging of
  batteries, monitors battery health, and extends battery life.

### 7. **Storage**

- **SD Cards or SSDs**: For onboard data storage, especially for recording
  flight data, captured images, and video. Consider a high-capacity and
  high-speed storage medium.

### 8. **Additional Sensors**

- **Ultrasonic Sensors**: For obstacle avoidance and height measurement in close
  proximity.
- **Barometers**: For altitude estimation.

### 9. **Ground Station**

- **Base Station**: A laptop or tablet with a ground control station (GCS)
  software like **QGroundControl** or **Mission Planner** to monitor drone
  status, program missions, and provide real-time updates.
- **Controller (RC)**: For manual control when necessary. Options include
  **FrSky**, **Spektrum**, or **TBS Crossfire**.

### 10. **Accessories**

- **Gimbals**: Stabilize the camera for smooth footage during flight.
- **Antennas**: Long-range antennas for enhanced communication range and signal
  strength.

### 11. **Charging and Docking**

- **Autonomous Charging Pads**: If you want to enable autonomous recharging of
  drones, look into induction or physical docking stations.

### 12. **Cooling Systems (Optional)**

- Depending on the onboard computing power, you may need to add small fans or
  heatsinks for **thermal management**, especially for Jetson Xavier or other
  high-performance modules.
